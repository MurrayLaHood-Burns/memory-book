# memory-book
Memory Book is my first attempt at web development using the MEAN stack.
It will be a simple webapp where users can upload and share old photo albums.
I plan on completing the project by the end of August, 2017.

Before setting of on this project, I learned the essentials of MEAN development through
a tutorial by thinkster.io (https://thinkster.io/tutorials/mean-stack), and my completed work
from that tutorial is at https://github.com/MurrayLaHood-Burns/flapper-news.

In addition to the skills I learned there, I have furthered my toolset in this project
by learning:
* Automated testing in nodejs using mocha, supertest, request, and pow-mongo-fixtures
* Useful logging practices using winston, such as attaching a log tag to request objects
to follow the request through layers of middleware
* Project structuring to keep files small, modular, and organized
